Scientists of the 19th Century (and into the 20th)

Several books and biographies that I have read this year reveal an excitement about science in the 19th century. Science was a hobby and entertainment for many people. They bought tickets to attend lectures about scientific advancements. The World Fairs of St Louis, Paris, and Chicago showcased the light bulb, dynamos or electric motors, and various technologies. Children explored electricity for fun. This focus on science throughout society across Europe and North America (and perhaps the world - at least Santos-Dumont of Brazil to name one outside Europe/NA) led to numerous advancements that forever changed the world: DC + AC current, lightbulb, phonograph, telephone, radio, (telegraph was a bit earlier)

## Books

### The Night ???, novel about the rivalry between Edison and Westinghouse

### Reluctant Genius, about Alexander Graham Bell - This book shares Mabel Bellâ€™s impact on his success. 

### The Wizard, the Life and Times of Nicola Tesla. I am listening to the audio book, and so I am missing key pieces of detail. That said, the book intersects with the historical novel mentioned above and so a reread will be in order. Note: the history of Serbia/Croatia in the beginning of the book is very interesting. 

### The Wright Brothers, by David McCullough - Their achievement came in 1903, but their research happened during the same exciting times.
